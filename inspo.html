            Thoughts on AI: AI is a double-edged sword. The more I work with it, the more positive I become. But the more I stop and think about it, the more concerned I become....

            One one hand, AI is a productivity game-changer. It can automate routine tasks, freeing up time for more strategic and creative work. This shift of menial tasks should open up new time for people to be innovative, and creative. Moreover, AI democratizes access to knowledge and resources. The intelligence of the world is available to anyone anytime, with an Internet connection and a prompt. This should help marginalized and under-educated communities catch up quickly with personalized learning experiences and enable them to participate fully in the global economy. In fields such as healthcare, energy, and science, AI can tackle some of the most challenging problems. In scientific research, AI can accelerate discoveries by analyzing vast amounts of data and identifying patterns that humans might miss.<br> 

            However, I'm concerned about the potential pitfalls of AI. The energy consumption required to power AI systems can be significant, and will have major impacts on environmental sustainability. Additionally, the automation of certain tasks poses a risk to some jobs, potentially leading to displacement and economic disruption. There is also the potential for AI to be misused by nation-states for surveillance or cyber warfare, and by cybercriminals to create deepfakes or create novel vulnerabilities and attacks. With governments and policy makers offering little leadership, capitalism and nation-states will succeed and selfish use is on. <br>

            In the near term, several hurdles and important items remain. Most importantly, the AI models must continue to be accurate to be fully trusted. Yet since they're built on nondeterministic large language models (LLMs), we've got some way to go to be able to truly trust AI's output. In parallel , business processes need to be streamlined before they're replaced with AI agents. In the meantime, augmenting them with human-in-the-loop technology will be an effective on-ramp. Finally, business data is going to need to be accurate and clean to be useful. <br>

            The possibilities are endless, and I am excited to see how AI will continue to shape our future, driving progress and creating opportunities. It's going to be a wild ride!
