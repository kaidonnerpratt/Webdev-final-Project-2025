            <b>Thoughts on AI:</b> AI is a double-edged sword. The more I work with it, the more positive I become. But the more I stop and think about it, the more concerned I become....<br><br>

            One one hand, AI is a productivity game-changer. It can automate routine tasks, freeing up time for more strategic and creative work. This shift of menial tasks should open up new time for people to be innovative, and creative. Moreover, AI democratizes access to knowledge and resources. The intelligence of the world is available to anyone anytime, with an Internet connection and a prompt. This should help marginalized and under-educated communities catch up quickly with personalized learning experiences and enable them to participate fully in the global economy. In fields such as healthcare, energy, and science, AI can tackle some of the most challenging problems. In scientific research, AI can accelerate discoveries by analyzing vast amounts of data and identifying patterns that humans might miss.<br><br> 

            However, I'm concerned about the potential pitfalls of AI. The energy consumption required to power AI systems can be significant, and will have major impacts on environmental sustainability. Additionally, the automation of certain tasks poses a risk to some jobs, potentially leading to displacement and economic disruption. There is also the potential for AI to be misused by nation-states for surveillance or cyber warfare, and by cybercriminals to create deepfakes or create novel vulnerabilities and attacks. With governments and policy makers offering little leadership, capitalism and nation-states will succeed and selfish use is on. <br><br>

            In the near term, several hurdles and important items remain. Most importantly, the AI models must continue to be accurate to be fully trusted. Yet since they're built on nondeterministic large language models (LLMs), we've got some way to go to be able to truly trust AI's output. In parallel , business processes need to be streamlined before they're replaced with AI agents. In the meantime, augmenting them with human-in-the-loop technology will be an effective on-ramp. Finally, business data is going to need to be accurate and clean to be useful. <br><br>

            The possibilities are endless, and I am excited to see how AI will continue to shape our future, driving progress and creating opportunities. It's going to be a wild ride!

            <h4 class="text-left">Narrow AI</h4>
            <p class="text-left"><b>What is it? </b><br>
                Narrow AI can sometimes be known as “weak AI”, and the reason for this is simply in its name. The AI is designed to execute only a narrow range of tasks, and performs that at an incredible level, often better than humans. However, this AI is not fit for understanding humans and how their intelligence works. <br>
                <b>What are examples?</b><br>
                One of the most common examples of narrow AI are voice assistants, such as Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, etc. These assistants perform their jobs of responding to humans nearly perfectly, but are not built to understand humans, just to perform tasks. Another, more exciting, example of narrow AI is self driving cars. These cars rely on pre-coded tasks, such as parking recognition and planned routes, to perform them almost perfectly. <br>
                <b>Disadvantages</b><br>
                This type of AI can only perform the tasks that it is specifically coded to execute. Therefore, the AI is unlikely to adapt to new situations because it lacks a general understanding for all other areas, besides the one it is coded into.

            <h4 class="text-left">General AI</h4>
            <p class="text-left"><b>What is it?</b><br>General AI is a hypothetical form of AI that can perform any intellectual task a human can. This ai is designed to answer questions in the way a person would. It can perform countless tasks, and is able to learn, adapt, and reason with new situations suggested by the user. <br>
                <b>What are Examples?</b><br>
                The most common general ai examples are Chat GPT, recommendation engines like those used in Google, Netflix, etc.  <br>
                <b>Disadvantages</b><br>
                A disadvantage of this type of AI is that it strips away human’s capability to perform tasks themselves. For example, general ai could result in risks of job displacement, privacy concerns, etc. <br>
